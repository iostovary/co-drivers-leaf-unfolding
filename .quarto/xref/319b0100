Shown are the VI of model variations with ΔcAIC < 2 (cAIC = conditional Akaike Information Criterion) relative to the model with the lowest cAIC that contain GDD and ≤ 10 main effects and interactions. A VI of 1 signals high importance relative to other variables, while lower values suggest that a variable appeared in fewer models or models with lower Akaike weights. Variables with the prefix “poly” were modelled with a non-linear relationship to DOY (Methods). The colon (:) indicates an interaction between two variables.
